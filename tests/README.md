# MCPVals Library Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the MCPVals library, organized by test type for better maintainability and development workflow.

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests (`unit/`)

Fast, isolated tests that focus on individual components without external dependencies.

#### Core Components (`unit/core/`)

- **`config.test.ts`** - Configuration loading, validation, and schema parsing
- **`trace.test.ts`** - TraceStore operations and data management

#### Evaluators (`unit/evaluators/`)

- **`deterministic.test.ts`** - DeterministicEvaluator metrics and logic
- **`llm-judge.test.ts`** - LLM judge evaluation functionality

#### Infrastructure (`unit/infrastructure/`)

- **`sse-validation.test.ts`** - SSE transport validation and configuration

#### Reporters (`unit/reporters/`)

- **`console.test.ts`** - Console output formatting and display

### Integration Tests (`integration/`)

Tests that verify component interactions using mocked external dependencies.

- **`evaluate.test.ts`** - Main evaluation pipeline integration
- **`runner.test.ts`** - ServerRunner with mocked MCP servers
- **`tool-health.test.ts`** - Tool health testing with mocked tools

### End-to-End Tests (`e2e/`)

Full system tests with real external dependencies (when possible).

- **`integration.test.ts`** - Complete evaluation scenarios with real configurations

### CLI Tests (`cli/`)

Command-line interface specific tests.

- **`cli.test.ts`** - CLI command parsing and execution
- **`eval.test.ts`** - Evaluation command integration

### Test Fixtures (`fixtures/`)

Shared test data, mock responses, and configuration files.

## Test Organization Benefits

### ðŸš€ **Performance**

- Unit tests run quickly during development
- Integration tests provide broader coverage
- E2E tests ensure system reliability

### ðŸŽ¯ **Focus**

- Easy to run specific test categories
- Clear separation of concerns
- Faster feedback loops

### ðŸ”§ **Maintenance**

- Related tests are grouped together
- Easier to locate and update tests
- Clear test dependencies and requirements

### ðŸ“Š **CI/CD Optimization**

- Parallel test execution by category
- Fail-fast unit testing
- Comprehensive pre-release validation

## Test Utilities and Mocking

### Mocked Dependencies

- **MCP SDK**: Client, transports, and connections
- **External processes**: `execa` for server spawning
- **AI SDK**: LLM interaction and tool calling
- **File system**: Temporary file creation and cleanup
- **Console output**: Captured for assertion testing

### Test Helpers

- Configuration factory functions
- Mock data generators for evaluations and tool health results
- Temporary file management
- Environment variable setup/teardown

## Best Practices

### Test Organization

- Group related functionality in the same directory
- Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario
- Organize tests by functionality using `describe` blocks
- Setup and teardown in `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks

### Mocking Strategy

- Mock external dependencies at module boundaries
- Use dependency injection where possible
- Preserve original behavior for internal logic
- Reset mocks between tests

### Assertions

- Test both success and failure paths
- Verify side effects and state changes
- Check error messages and types
- Validate output formatting and content

### Test Data

- Use factory functions for consistent test data
- Parameterize tests for multiple scenarios
- Include edge cases and boundary conditions
- Test with realistic data sizes and complexity

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically on:

- Pull request creation and updates
- Main branch commits
- Release preparation
- Scheduled daily runs

Coverage reports are generated and tracked to ensure quality standards are maintained.
