# Core Concepts

MCPVals provides comprehensive testing for all MCP specification primitives:

1.  **Tool Health Testing**: Directly calls individual tools with specific arguments to verify their correctness, performance, and error handling. This is ideal for unit testing and regression checking.

2.  **Resource Evaluation**: Tests MCP resources (data and context) including discovery, access validation, URI template testing, content validation, and subscription capabilities.

3.  **Prompt Evaluation**: Validates MCP prompts (templates and workflows) with argument testing, template generation, security validation, and dynamic content evaluation.

4.  **Sampling Evaluation**: Tests MCP sampling capabilities (server-initiated LLM requests) including capability negotiation, human-in-the-loop workflows, model preferences, and security controls.

5.  **Workflow Evaluation**: Uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language prompts and execute a series of tool calls to achieve a goal. This tests the integration of your MCP primitives from an LLM's perspective.

6.  **OAuth 2.1 Testing**: Comprehensive OAuth 2.1 authentication flow testing with PKCE, resource indicators (RFC 8707), multi-tenant support, and security validation. Tests authorization code flows, client credentials, device flows, token management, and security controls.
